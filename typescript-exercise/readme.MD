### Convert this JavaScript project to TypeScript. TypeScript is already installed and ready to go.

## The index.ts file is already created but contains no TypeScript yet. There are three other files in the src/utilties folder that need attention.

### string.js
### numbers.js
### arrays.js
# Look at the package.json files to see the scripts available to run.

## You'll need to:

### Convert the file extensions
### Convert CommonJS modules to ES6 modules
### Build the code to gather TypeScript errors
### Explicitly type all functions
### Fix any other issues
### NOTE: a popup of "Renderer Failure: tsconfig.json" will open when starting this project. It is safe to ignore this error. Error is due to the comments in tsconfig.json not being considered valid JSON; however, it is generally considered safe to place comments in JSON config files.
